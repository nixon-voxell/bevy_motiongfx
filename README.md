# Bevy MotionGfx

Bevy Motiongfx is a motion graphics creation tool in [Bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy). It is highly inspired by [Motion Canvas](https://motioncanvas.io/) & [Manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim).

## Goal

The goal of this tool is to procedurally generate animations with code. It is designed to offer the following features:

- Ease of use.
- Performance by default.
- Real-time preview.
- First class support for Bevy ECS.
- Robust (can be used not just for animation productions, but for all sorts of applications e.g. game development).

## Why this tool?

Procedurally coded animations can be easily scaled to larger projects (e.g. code can be reused/extended/structured).

### Streamlining timeline editing with code-based animation

Reorganizing strips and keyframes, particularly when rearranging clips, can be a laborious endeavor. However, with coded animations, the process becomes remarkably efficient. Swapping sections in the timeline is as simple as shifting lines of code up and down, allowing for swift and hassle-free adjustments.

Here is an image (by [aarthificial](https://youtu.be/WTUafAwrunE)) comparing keyframes and code:
